Android application that helps users organize/sort large numbers of files on their phones with great flexibility. Currently uses a text-based interface (CLI) to

* Select the root directory that contains the files that you wish to sort.
* Select your target file group (i.e. files that you wish to sort) by entering your desired paramters (e.g. file type, size, name, last modified date range, etc). You 
can even select files in subdirectories.
* Select your desired sort method(s) (i.e. how you want to sort your selected files) by entering your desired sort method options and parameters. Sort methods will be 
applied in the order specified (left to right).
